#FAQ

- What is DAC? 
: For simply documentation, DAC (Digital-To-Analog Converter)  A DAC takes digital data and transforms it into an analog audio signal. Afterward, it sends that analog signal to an amplifier. When you hear digital recordings, you’re actually listening to an analog signal that was converted from digital by a DAC. Even if you can’t see the DAC – although you sometimes can, as we’ll explore shortly – it’s there (from: https://www.audioadvice.com/content/what-is-a-dac/)

- Is Mido / Redmi Note 4X have a DAC?
: For generally isn't, DAC is a external hardware but Qualcomm somehow include that hardware into our soundcard (wcd9335) with Qualcomm Aqstic™ Audio Codec that support Hi-Fi / Hi-Res Playback up to 24bit / 192Khz (from: https://www.qualcomm.com/products/wcd9335)

- So Mido shouldn't have any problem with that feature, right?
: If you're on stock ROM (MIUI) then you'll be fine, cause DAC in that ROM is perfectly working, but if you're on custom ROM, specially for oreo or higher then i'm not sure. Since so much change on audio CAF or blobs source for following stream to always up to date, then some features like this can't be accessed.

- How can i know if my DAC is working or not in Oreo or Pie ROMs?
: You can use application on playstore that can have access to your DAC directly without any preset or effects, so far i only tested on Neutron Music Player and UAPP.
